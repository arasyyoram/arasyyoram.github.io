March 14, 2022, is the first day of the Generasi Gigih class. There are many foreigners gathered at once in a program. No one knows each other, and neither do I. Being present in the midst of people who are completely foreign to me is quite a difficult thing. How to interact with people who come from all kinds of backgrounds, how to greet them, how to join their discussion, trivial things that are never a problem for the extrovert, but are a problem for me.

Even so, I was very happy to meet new friends. So, this is my way of adapting to a new environment.

**Growth mindset**

Maybe many of us often hear this term on the internet. But few of us can be like in these terms.

The growth mindset is basically your ability to believe that nothing in your life is eternal. You can control everything in your life.

And from this growth mindset that we recognize the term **The Power of Yet.**

It's not that you can't do something, but NOT YET.

I apply it when adapting to a new environment.

When I interact with new people, I usually think "maybe he doesn't like talking to me", but I change it to "he probably doesn't like talking to me yet".

When I was stuck while writing code, I didn't think “I can’t be able to write this code”, but I changed it to “I can't be able to write this code yet”.

Changing the word "can't" to "not yet", really helps beat our fixed mindset.

So, practicing a growth mindset and applying The Power of Yet helped me to adapt to all conditions.
