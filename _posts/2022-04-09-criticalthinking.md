In this writing, I want to share my process using the Question Formulation Technique or QFT to consider a statement below.

Statement: <u>Grit is the most important traits to survive in Generasi GIGIH (or life)</u>

### Produce and improve:

* What is Grit? [OPEN]
* <mark>Why can it be the most important trait to survive? [OPEN]</mark>
* What happens if we don’t have this grit? [OPEN]
* <mark>Is there anyone out there who can still survive without grit? [CLOSED]</mark>
* <del>Is it valid?</del> [CLOSED] → Is it valid grit is the most important trait to survive?
* Is there any scientific evidence? [CLOSED]
* Who is the person who coined this term? [CLOSED]
* Where can I implement this kind of trait? [OPEN]
* When do I need this grit and not? [OPEN]
* How to have this trait? [OPEN]
* What next if I already have this trait? [OPEN]
* <mark>What if I already have this trait but still failed? [OPEN]</mark>

### Top 3 questions:
* Why can it be the most important trait to survive?
* Is there anyone out there who can still survive without grit?
* What if I already have this trait but still failed?

### The next steps:
* I will find some resource what this trait is the most important to survive
* I will find people who can still survive without this trait and analyse them
* I will find the factor who make this trait doesn’t work

### Reflect:
Using this QFT method, I learned how to question a statement and criticize it. It helps me to make better decisions to take. 

From the questions I asked, this led me to the conclusion that Grit is one of the factors that make us survive in achieving our goals. I saw a lot of clear evidence from the Generasi Gigih that many did not continue this program because they did not have this trait. In my opinion, this grit is also more than that, it is a trait that we must cultivate in life, because sometimes we stop achieving our goals not because it's not that we don't like it but we don't have the perseverance to overcome every obstacle that exists.
